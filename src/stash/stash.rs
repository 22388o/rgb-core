//! API for working with stash: storage of RGB contract client-side-validated
//! data and data containers.
//!
//! Client-side-validated data, and (especially) data containers may grow large
//! (multiple gigabytes) and can't be fit in a memory as a single data
//! structure. Thus, we utilize a special API which abstracts the specific stash
//! storage mechanism (file-based, SQL or NoSQL database, special disk
//! partitions, cloud-provided storage, like with Bifrost protocol, etc).
//! With this API the data can be accessed using iterators or by providing the
//! specific data id.
//!
//! NB: Stash implementations must be able to operate multiple independent RGB
//! contract.
